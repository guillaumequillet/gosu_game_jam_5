# Gosu Game Jam 5 : ASTEROIDS

ASTEROIDS ! is a Gosu Game Jam 5 project ! The theme was : Asteroids. The game was all done using Ruby and the Gosu Gem.

Controls

Press Arrow keys to move the spaceship.
Press Space key to shoot a laser
Press Enter key to use a Bomb that will clear all the screen !
An asteroid will kill your ship on contact. It will split in two pieces if a laser hits it and if it is still big enough to split in half.

If it was too small to split, it may give some reward bonus : extra life or extra bomb. A good strategy to get the best score may be to split as much asteroids as possible before using a useful bomb... and get bonuses !
